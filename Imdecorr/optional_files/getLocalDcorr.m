%
% Estimate the image local cut-off frequency based on decorrelation analysis 
%
% Inputs:
%  im        	2D image to be analyzed
%  tileSize		Size of a tile in pixels
%  tileOverlap  Spatial overlap between two consecutive tiles
%  r           	Fourier space sampling of the analysis (default: r = linspace(0,1,50)
%  Ng			Number of high-pass filtering (default: Ng = 10)
%  figID		If figID > 1, curves will be plotted in figure(figID)
%
% Outputs:
%  kcMax        Estimated cut-off frequency of the image in normalized frequency for each sectors
%  A0			Amplitude of the local maxima of d0 for each sectors
%  kcGM			Estimated cut-off frequency using Geometric-Mean metric for each sectors
%  d0 			Decorrelation function before high-pass filtering for each sectors
%  d			All decorrelation functions for each sectors
