% cc = getCorrcoef(I1,I2,c1,c2)
% ---------------------------------------
%
% Return the normalized correlation coefficient expressed in Fourier space
%
% Inputs:
%  I1        	Complex Fourier transfom of image 1
%  I2           Complex Fourier transfom of image 2
%
% Outputs:
%  cc        	Normalized cross-correlation coefficient
